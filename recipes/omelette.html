    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>dish you might order for breakfast or brunch — it's kind of like a folded pancake made of beaten eggs,</p>
    <p>sometimes with the addition of vegetables, cheese, or meat. Yum. A good omelet is a little bit fluffy, but firm enough to contain its filling.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 large eggs
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon unsalted butter
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons grated cheese, any kind
        </li>
        <li>
            3 to 4 cherry tomatoes, cut in half and sprinkled lightly with salt
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons chopped basil, parsley, or herb of your choice
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Prep the eggs In a bowl, beat the eggs with a fork.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt the butter In an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat, melt the butter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the eggs and cook the omelette:
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the eggs to the skillet and cook without stirring until the edges begin to set.
        </li>
        <li>
            With a silicone spatula, push the edges toward the center of the pan and tilt the pan so the uncooked eggs move to the edge.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat until the eggs are somewhat set but still a little soft in the center, about 6 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fill the omelette Place the cheese, tomatoes, and herbs in a line down the center of the omelette and cook for about 1 minute longer, or until the eggs are mostly set but still a little soft in the center.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fold and plate the omelette
        </li>
        <li>
            Slide the spatula around one side of the omelette at the edge to loosen it. Slip it under the eggs, and use it to carefully fold the omelette in half.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slide the spatula under the folded omelette to loosen it from the pan. Tilt the pan over a plate and use the spatula to nudge it onto the plate. Voila!
        </li>
    </ol>
