    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The idea behind a Smashburger is that instead of letting a big, fat burger languish on the grill to cook, you add the burger meat to a rip-roaring hot skillet or griddle and smash it as it cooks for the first few seconds. The heat plus pressure combo results in a crispy and well-browned burger that cooks very fast.

            Loosely divide the ground beef into four even balls. Season the balls of beef with a 1/8 teaspoon burger seasoning mix. Don’t worry about completely covering them. You can add more seasoning when they are cooking.

            Ingredients to make a smashburger-style burger recipe.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the smashburgers
        </li>
        <li>
            Wrap a heavy skillet (cast iron works well) with some foil, you will use this to smash the burgers. I use a smaller 8-inch cast iron skillet, but any smaller size will work.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn on the fan over the stove and open a window to help with air flow.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large skillet or griddle (I do not recommend using non-stick) set over medium-high heat add one tablespoon of butter. Once the butter has melted, add the beef balls.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the foil wrapped skillet or a spatula over the beef balls and smash them into flat disks. Smash each burger for 10 seconds, one at a time, applying a lot of pressure to it. Repeat until all the burgers are smashed.

        <li>
            Season burgers with more mix and continue to cook
        </li>
        <li>
            Season the smashburgers with another 1/8 teaspoon burger seasoning mix. Allow them to continue to cook for about 90 seconds until the juices start to bubble from the burger. Use a sturdy metal spatula to flip the burgers, being sure to scrap up any caramelization.

            How to make smashburgers with four patties on a griddle.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add cheese to the burgers
        </li>
        <li>
            After you’ve flipped the burgers, add cheese (I like 1 1/2 slices per burger) and continue to cook for 2-3 minutes, until burgers are cooked to desired doneness, usually medium. The burger is so thin that there’s no need to check temperature. It will be done if the burger has a good caramelization on the outside. You can continue to cook for another 30 seconds if you want a very well done burger.

            Four burger patties in a skillet with two topped with cheese to show how to make smashburgers
        </li>
        <li>
            Toast the burger buns
        </li>
        <li>
            While burgers cook, toast the buns. In a large skillet over medium heat add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter. Add the buns, cut side down, and toast for 30 seconds, until golden. Repeat until all buns are toasted. If you have a griddle, you can toast the buns alongside the burgers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Build and serve the smashburgers
        </li>
        <li>
            Build a smashburger by adding some sauce, approximately 1 tablespoon, to the bottom of the burger bun. Add lettuce over the top of the sauce, then add a smashburger, and finally top with sliced red onion and tomato. Continue until all smashburgers are assembled.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve immediately with fries and a cold drink.
